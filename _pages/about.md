Hey there! Welcome to my site. I hope you enjoy your stay and learn something interesting.

# Me
I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, where I live now. I usually don't like talking about myself so I'll keep this brief. If you're really curious, you can always [email me](mailto:hello@victorbilgin.com).

- I'm working full-time as a Help Desk Specialist for [Houlihan Lokey](), a global investment bank.
- I'm going to school full-time at [Western Governors University]() to get my B.S. in Cloud and Systems Administration.
- My main focus now is IT (specifically infrastructure, cloud, and offensive security).
- I have a few other interests that I like to work into my free time including graphic design and web development.
- I like learning how things work and think about the future a little too much.

# This site
So, what's the point of this site? It's a place for me to share my thoughts through blog posts. It's also a place for me to explore web development and graphic design. This site has gone through a lot of changes - not only in terms of design but also structure and implementation.

As of August 2020 (when I'm writing this), this site is on its sixth version. I built it from scratch with [Jekyll]() and it's hosted on [Netlify](). The code is open-sourced under the MIT license on [Github]().
