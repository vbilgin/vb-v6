# School
Still attending [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) and pursuing their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration degree. Set to graduate in mid-2021. Currently studying for the LPI Linux Essentials exam.

# Work
Started a new job in March 2020 working as a Help Desk Specialist for [Houlihan Lokey](https://hl.com/).

I've mostly adjusted to the job and feel comfortable tackling most issues that come up. Planning to hunker down and absorb as much knowledge as I can.
